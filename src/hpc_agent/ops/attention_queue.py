"""The attention-queue item model, per-kind collectors, and the D2 total order.

Design: ``docs/design/attention-queue.md`` (Wave B / T1). The queue AGGREGATES
existing predicates (D5) and adds SELECTION + ORDERING only — any recomputation
of a verdict, a staleness, or a liveness comparison inside this package is a
defect by definition (the route-through tests pin each collector to its one
source symbol via ``inspect.getsource``).

One-definition seams (D5 table), each collector routing through the named symbol:

* ``greenlight-unadvanced`` / ``run-parked`` — ``state/index.py::find_parked_runs``
  split by ``state/decision_journal.py::is_latest_committed_greenlight`` (the same
  pair ``doctor`` and the Stop guard key on — the queue becomes the THIRD surface
  that must agree, and it calls the same symbols, so it cannot disagree).
* ``run-stalled`` — ``state/index.py::find_stalled_runs``.
* ``dead-worker`` — ``ops/recover/doctor.py::scan_dead_detached_workers``.
* ``run-anomaly`` — ``ops/status_blocks.py``'s promoted reduction
  (``digest_run`` + ``ANOMALY_STATUSES`` + ``recommendation_for``), supersession
  exclusion intact.
* ``campaign-pending`` — ``state/decision_journal.py::latest_decision`` +
  ``is_latest_committed_greenlight`` over ``scope_kind="campaign"``.
* ``audit-section-*`` — ``state/notebook_audit.py::audit_module`` (sources resolved
  by the same seam the sign-off gate uses).
* ``alert`` — ``ops/recover/notify.py::read_unacknowledged_alerts`` (peek-only).
* ``ssh-circuit-open`` — ``ops/recover/net_triage.py::open_circuit_lines``.

The D2 ordering was REVISED (user, 2026-07-08 — leverage-primary): the primary
sort key is LEVERAGE = the unblock fan-out COUNTED over the dependency edges the
journals already encode (:func:`_apply_fanout` / :func:`order_items`), never a
score. Full order: fan-out descending → class → oldest ``since`` → (kind,
scope_id). Where no encoded edge exists fan-out is 0 and the item falls through to
the class order byte-identically with the pre-revision rule.

Watermark-neutral + store-free (D6): this package moves no state — it never calls
``mark_seen_by_human`` or ``acknowledge_alerts``, and writes no file anywhere.
Pure-ish read: it reads journals via the source predicates, holds no SSH, no
``_wire`` import, and no scheduler.

    carries no urgency; ``since`` is the sample's own ``ts`` so it ages honestly.
