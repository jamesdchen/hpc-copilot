"""``submit-s1``..``submit-s4`` — the submit workflow as human-amplification blocks.

The submit flow, decomposed (docs/design/human-amplification-blocks.md §3) into
four blocks, each a THIN orchestrator that composes existing rings and TERMINATES
at a human decision point carrying code-digested evidence (a *brief*). No decision
is resolved by the LLM: code chains deterministically as far as it can, then hands
back the brief for the ``y``/nudge propose loop (§2).

* ``submit-s1`` (resolve) — preflight + walk-submit-ambiguities. Surfaces each
  ambiguity's ``safe_default`` as a PRE-FILLED RECOMMENDATION (§6 line 181),
  never auto-applied into ``resolved`` — ``apply-safe-defaults`` is the silent
  actor this kills, so S1 does NOT call it. When the walk is clean and a
  ``resolve`` spec is supplied, chains ``resolve-submit-inputs`` to a
  ``resolved`` / ``prior_run_found`` terminator.
* ``submit-s2`` (stage & canary) — ``submit-and-verify`` stopped after a verified
  canary + the ``estimate-core-hours`` footprint. Brief: "canary green, est N
  core-hours".
* ``submit-s3`` (submit & watch) — Phase-2 main-array launch + ``monitor-flow``
  to terminal/anomaly + ``decide-monitor-arm``. Runs unattended.
* ``submit-s4`` (harvest) — ``aggregate-flow`` → a code-extracted results table
  + a slot for proposed interpretations.

Each block owns its invariants at the boundary (adding-a-primitive.md): it
validates the wire spec (the embedded models do the shape work) and fails loudly
via the composed rings. The block bodies stay THIN — they never reimplement ring
logic, only sequence it and digest the evidence into a brief.

    LLM fills at the ``y``/nudge boundary — code extracts the results; the human

    NOTE (Unit B dependency): a ``harvest_on_terminal`` guarantee (§5) is being
