"""Field→stage ownership facade — the §4 routing SoT (the load-bearing gap).

block-drive.md §4 routes a nudge by which stage OWNS the edited field:

| Approved spec vs last-run inputs | Route |
|---|---|
| unchanged                                   | **advance** to the next block |
| changed, field owned by the **current** block | **re-run** the block |
| changed, fields owned by a **downstream** block | **advance, carrying the edit** |

That decision needs a field→stage map per workflow — which block RESOLVES each
field. Today only submit has ``ops/submit/field_partition.py`` (a required-vs-
auto-resolvable partition, NOT a stage map). This module is the missing map for
all four families: :data:`OWNERSHIP` maps ``{workflow: {field: owning_verb}}``,
and :func:`route` turns "which fields changed" + the current block position into
the §4 advance / rerun / advance_carrying decision, using
:mod:`hpc_agent.infra.block_chain` for block ordering.

§4 itself flags ownership completeness as the load-bearing open gap: submit's
map is read off ``submit_blocks.py`` (resource resolution → S1, cost/canary →
S2, submit/watch → S3, harvest → S4); status/aggregate/campaign fields land on
the FIRST block of their family (their specs are greenlit / read once, so there
is no meaningful downstream owner yet) with ``# TODO(wave4)`` markers where the
grain is genuinely ambiguous. Do not over-engineer past what §4 needs.
