    """Human-authorship gate: refuse committing a REQUIRED_CALLER field whose
    value has no human-attributed utterance on record.

    Proving run #4: the driving agent FABRICATED a ``task_generator`` ("20
    seeds × 1M samples") by reading the executor, presented it as a
    recommendation, and the human's bare ``y`` laundered it into ``resolved``
    as "caller-supplied". The field partition's no-fabricate lock
    (:mod:`hpc_agent.ops.submit.field_partition`) held — no safe_default can
    exist for a required-caller field — but nothing distinguished
    human-authored from agent-authored caller values at the commit point.
    This gate closes that seam at ``append-decision``, beside the rule-9
    brief-provenance gate.

    **Trigger** — the record's ``resolved`` introduces a
    :data:`~hpc_agent.ops.submit.field_partition.REQUIRED_CALLER_FIELDS`
    member (imported, never redefined; today ``goal`` / ``task_generator``)
    for the FIRST time in this scope's journal. A field already present in a
    prior record's ``resolved`` was gated when it was committed — subsequent
    decisions are unaffected.

    **Check** — the value must be derivable from HUMAN text, taken from the
    strongest source available:

    * **Utterance log present** (the ``UserPromptSubmit`` capture hook,
      :mod:`hpc_agent._kernel.hooks.utterance_capture`, has logged prompts
      for this repo — :func:`hpc_agent.state.utterances.read_utterances`):
      the human texts are the LOGGED UTTERANCES, written by the harness
      out-of-band. Journal ``response`` fields — agent-authored — carry no
      authorship weight in this mode: a substantive ``response`` cannot
      commit a free-text field, and response numbers cannot support a
      structured one. This is the lock the v1 gate staged.
    * **No utterance log** (hook not installed / older sessions —
      back-compat fail-open): this record's ``response`` plus every prior
      record's ``response`` in the scope's journal (a prior nudge that
      stated the sweep authorizes a later bare ``y``).

    Per-field rules, against the chosen human texts:

    * Structured fields (``task_generator``): every number token the value
      asserts must be human-derivable (:func:`_human_derivable` — verbatim,
      magnitude-suffixed like ``1M``, zero, or a range endpoint of a stated
      count). A consecutive-int list asserts only its endpoints and length
      (:func:`_contiguous_int_run` — "20 seeds" derives ``seeds=[0..19]``;
      proving run #5's finding was the gate demanding the enumeration). Its
      non-numeric CATEGORICAL string claims must ALSO overlap the human word
      pool (:func:`_collect_value_string_tokens`, finding 25) — schema
      vocabulary (dict keys, the ``kind`` discriminator value) exempt — so a
      fabricated ``dataset`` axis cannot ride a passing number check. A value
      with no number OR string claims falls back to the free-text rule.
    * Free-text fields (``goal``): the value's word tokens must overlap some
      human text; in journal-response mode only, a non-bare committing
      ``response`` (:func:`_is_bare_ack`) also commits it.

    **Fail-open** only in journal-response mode where the journal genuinely
    lacks response text: prior records exist and NONE carries a ``response``
    key (old-schema journals). An empty/absent value is not a commit and is
    never gated.

    **Honesty — the trust model is tiered, not uniform.** With the capture
    hook installed, the authorship evidence is HARNESS-captured: the hook
    fires before the model sees the prompt, so the utterance log is text a
    human verifiably typed, and this gate is a lock — "a guard the LLM
    itself satisfies is not a guard" (engineering-principles) no longer
    applies to the evidence source. Without the hook, the fallback evidence
    (journal ``response`` fields) is agent-authored, and the v1 friction
    posture stands: it kills the OBSERVED failure — bare-``y`` laundering,
    rationalization rather than fraud — but a determined agent could still
    fabricate a human quote. Refusing the fallback outright would break
    every pre-hook install, so back-compat wins there.

    Raises :class:`errors.SpecInvalid` naming the field(s), the underivable
    token(s), the evidence source consulted, and the remedy (the human
    states the sweep in a prompt / their reply).
