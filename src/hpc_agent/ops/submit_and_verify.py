"""``submit-and-verify``: two-phase canary gate over submit-flow + verify-canary.

One call instead of /submit-hpc then /verify-canary. The canary is a GATE
(#160): submit the 1-task canary FIRST (``canary_only``), verify it lands and
produces output, and launch the main array ONLY on success — so a broken
dispatch never reaches the full run.

This is a workflow-composes-workflow primitive: ``submit-flow`` and
``verify-canary`` are both workflow-verb primitives in their own right;
``submit-and-verify`` chains them under one envelope.

Paths:

* ``spec.submit.canary=False`` — no canary, so the main array submits directly
  and there's nothing to verify. ``verified=False``, ``verify_result=None``.
* Phase 1 ``submit-flow`` returns ``deduped=True`` (the run already exists) —
  no fresh canary; pass the submit result through without a stale verify.
* Canary verified → Phase 2 launches the main array; ``verified=True`` with the
  main ``job_ids``.
* Canary FAILED → the main array never launches; ``verified=False``,
  ``failure_kind`` set, and ``job_ids`` empty.
