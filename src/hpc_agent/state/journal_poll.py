"""Journal-read polling helper — learn a run's outcome WITHOUT touching the cluster.

The connection-storm lesson (the 0.10.63 ban): an LLM that *sits in the
connection loop* — submits, schedules a wake-up, polls SSH in prose — is the
hazard. The deterministic composites (``status-pipeline`` / ``submit-pipeline``)
already own the connection and run to terminal in plain code; the fix this
module supports is to run that composite in a DETACHED subprocess of the CLI
(see :mod:`hpc_agent._kernel.lifecycle.detached`) and have the orchestrator
learn the outcome by *reading the journal*, never by opening its own SSH.

So this helper is deliberately **read-only and cluster-free**: it reads the
per-run journal record (``~/.claude/hpc/<repo_hash>/runs/<run_id>.json``) — the
same on-disk state ``monitor_flow`` writes as it polls — and reports whether the
run has reached a terminal :class:`JournalStatus`. The orchestrator loops over
:func:`poll_until_terminal` (or its own ``sleep`` + :func:`read_run_status`)
while the detached runner drives the connection; the model is out of the loop,
exactly as :mod:`hpc_agent.infra.retry` states the principle.

Why the JOURNAL status, not the monitor-flow ``lifecycle_state`` envelope: a
timed-out run's cluster jobs may still be live, so monitor-flow returns
``lifecycle_state='timeout'`` but the journal record stays ``in_flight`` (see
``state.journal._RESUBMITTABLE_TERMINAL_STATUSES``). The journal status is the
durable "is this run done?" signal the submit/dedup paths already key off, so
the poller keys off it too — a timed-out-but-still-live run is correctly NOT
terminal here, and the caller keeps waiting (or re-arms the detached runner).
