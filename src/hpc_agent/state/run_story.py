"""The run story — per-stream record→event projections + the one merge.

Design: ``docs/design/run-story.md`` (Wave A / T1, governed by decisions D1
sources, D2 merge, D3 event model). The run story is a PURE projection of a
run's complete journal trail into one deterministic, ordered, attributed
timeline — the decision journal's *interface* sibling. It journals nothing,
attests nothing, and interprets nothing: every event is IDENTITY (which
run/scope/section), ORDERING (merge by recorded ts), and COUNTING (sha
pointers, row/job counts) over opaque records — never what any record MEANS.

This module owns two things and only two:

* :class:`StoryEvent` — the frozen, 7-field event model (D3). Its shape is
  closed; no domain/metric/role vocabulary ever grows a field.
* the per-stream projections (one small function per D1 stream, closed ``kind``
  sets) and :func:`merge_events` — the ONE ordering definition (D2). A second
  re-sort anywhere else forks the timeline (the boundary-drift flag).

Reads route through the existing store readers
(:func:`~hpc_agent.state.decision_journal.read_decisions`,
:func:`~hpc_agent.state.decision_briefs.read_briefs`,
:func:`~hpc_agent.state.block_terminal.read_terminal`,
:func:`~hpc_agent.state.journal.load_run`, and a tolerant read alongside
:func:`~hpc_agent.state.scopes.looks_path`); every one is tolerant of an
absent/corrupt store (one bad record never strands the trail — the
tolerant-read doctrine).

Pure I/O-thin state module (the :mod:`hpc_agent.state.scopes` posture): no
``_wire`` import, no SSH, no mapreduce. The ``ops`` layer (Wave B / T4) owns
the Pydantic boundary, the header assembly, and the windowing/render.

    """Merge events into the ONE deterministic timeline (D2). The only ordering.

    The merge key is the triple ``(ts, stream_rank, intra_stream_index)``:

    * ``ts`` — lexicographic compare of the ISO-8601 stamp IS chronological
      within this system (no datetime parsing). A missing ts is ``""`` and
      sorts to the epoch-front.
    * ``stream_rank`` — same-second cross-writer ties break by
      :data:`STREAM_RANK`.
    * ``intra_stream_index`` — append order within one stream is causal by
      construction and is NEVER reordered. This is realized by Python's STABLE
      sort: for equal ``(ts, stream_rank)`` the input order is preserved, so a
      caller that feeds each stream's events in append order (as
      :func:`build_story` does) gets intra-file order for free.

    A second re-sort of the result anywhere else forks the timeline (the
    boundary-drift flag) — this is the single ordering definition.
