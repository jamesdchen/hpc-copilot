"""The declarative harness-activation profile — WHAT to wire, not HOW.

Activation (installing hpc-agent's capability *providers* into a harness's
config) was Claude-Code-only: :func:`hpc_agent.agent_assets.install_agent_assets`
hand-built ``settings.json`` / ``.claude.json`` inline. This module lifts the
*declarative* content of that install — the hook inventory, the fused Stop
dispatcher, and the MCP server invocation — into a frozen
:class:`HarnessProfile` whose fields carry **mechanism description only**, and a
:class:`ClaudeCodeProfile` renderer that maps that neutral description into
Claude Code's exact config layout (byte-identical to the pre-refactor install —
pinned by ``tests/cli/test_profile_golden.py``).

**Doctrine — the profile is MECHANISM, never AUTHORIZATION (activation plan
§5-R3 / premortem D6).** A ``HarnessProfile`` describes which providers to wire;
installing it grants ZERO trust. It carries no ``capabilities`` /
``provides`` / ``grants`` / ``trust`` / ``conformant`` field — a self-asserted
capability manifest is the named failure shape and is impossible by construction
(the field set is CLOSED and frozen, pinned by
``tests/contracts/test_harness_profile_boundary.py``). Capability presence is
proven only by BEHAVIOR (the conformance kit's ``declared == detected ==
behaved``) and read only from the DETECTED settings-seam
(:func:`hpc_agent.ops.harness_capabilities`) — never from "a profile was
installed." No code in the trust path (gates / verify / journal) imports or
reads this module; that too is a fired pin (the consumer-trace AST test).

**Neutral event semantics.** Hook descriptors name their turn-boundary event in
harness-neutral terms (:class:`HookEvent`: ``session-start`` / ``on-prompt`` /
``pre-tool`` / ``post-tool`` / ``turn-final``) and their tool-matcher intent
(:class:`ToolClass`: ``none`` / ``shell`` / ``question``). A foreign harness
maps those to its OWN event model; :class:`ClaudeCodeProfile` maps them to Claude
Code's ``Stop`` / ``PreToolUse`` / ``PostToolUse`` / ``UserPromptSubmit`` /
``SessionStart`` strings and its ``Bash`` / ``AskUserQuestion`` matchers.

**The needle-embed obligation on ANY renderer (activation plan §5-R2 /
premortem D8).** Each descriptor carries its hook module path as the ``needle``
— load-bearing DATA: it is written INTO the rendered command AND is the key the
capability probe (:func:`hpc_agent.ops.harness_capabilities`) and the re-find /
self-heal matcher (:func:`hpc_agent.agent_assets._find_hook_entry_index`) match
an installed entry on. **A conforming renderer — ours OR a foreign one — MUST
embed the descriptor's ``needle`` substring verbatim in the command it emits**,
whatever invocation shape it chooses (``python -m <needle>``, a wrapper script,
a container exec). A renderer that drops the needle installs hooks the
capability probe can never see: the harness self-reports the capability ABSENT
while its hooks are in fact wired, and our re-find/self-heal never converges.
This is a *documented contract* on the renderer, not an enforced seam — no
foreign-renderer seam exists yet (it lands with the Wave-C adapters); our own
:class:`ClaudeCodeProfile` satisfies it and the golden test pins that every
rendered command mentions its needle.
