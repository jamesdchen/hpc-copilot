"""Pydantic models for the ``notebook-draft-context`` query verb.

Wire surface over :mod:`hpc_agent.ops.notebook.draft_context_op` — the drafting
projection that mechanizes run #10's hand-written "drafting brief"
(``docs/design/draft-context.md``). Given a template ``.py`` and the same
caller-declared, OPAQUE roots the audit already uses, it emits ONE deterministic
artifact the drafting agent reads INSTEAD of N discovery greps:

1. **template sections** — the template's slugs + cell prose, verbatim;
2. **resolved engines** — for each name the template imports, the resolving file
   under ``source_roots`` (the SAME resolution ``notebook-lint`` uses — one
   definition), the symbol's ``path:lineno``, its signature (``ast.unparse`` of
   the def's args), first docstring line, and ``module_sha``. All AST; no import
   is ever executed;
3. **name-match call sites** — ``Call`` nodes whose name matches an engine,
   across ``source_roots``, as ``path:lineno`` (+count, capped, cap DISCLOSED —
   the no-silent-caps rule). Labeled honestly "name-match" (AST identity, not
   type resolution);
4. **inventory** — files + ``sha12`` + size under ``input_roots`` and each
   ``inventory_roots`` entry (roots OPAQUE — core never knows what a "config" is).
   When a ``.hpc/data_manifest.json`` is present, an entry CITES its recorded sha
   rather than re-hashing.

Altitude boundary: the projection LISTS, never NOMINATES. It attaches no meaning
to a root, ranks no section, and names no "baseline" config — that is
program-binding / pack knowledge. The ``markdown`` render is the TRUSTED-DISPLAY
class: the LLM relays / points at it, never re-summarizes.
