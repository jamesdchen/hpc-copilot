"""SSH-driven cluster status reporter.

Both ``ops/monitor`` (`poll-run-status`), ``ops/aggregate`` (the
`aggregate-flow` composite reads status before reduce), and
``ops/recover`` (`failures` atom enriches failures with status) need
the same remote-side status JSON. Living here means none of those
subjects reach into another to fetch it.

The function shells out via :func:`hpc_agent.infra.remote.ssh_run`
to ``python -m hpc_agent.execution.mapreduce.reduce.status`` on the
cluster head node, parses the returned JSON, and raises
:class:`~hpc_agent.errors.RemoteCommandFailed` on transport or
parse failure.
