"""The single source of truth for the deterministic block SUCCESSOR (§6/§8).

``next_block`` is **re-homed** (block-drive.md §6/§8) from an LLM affordance to
the driver's internal chaining table: the sequencing moves to code, the SoT is
projected — never copied. Before this, four block modules each carried a local
``_next_block(verb, why, **spec_hint)`` helper with the successor VERB hardcoded
at every terminator call site (``ops/submit_blocks.py``, ``ops/status_blocks.py``,
``ops/aggregate_blocks.py``, ``meta/campaign/blocks.py``). This module lifts the
``(current_verb, stage_reached) -> successor_verb`` mapping out of those call
sites into one authoritative table so the ``block-drive`` driver reads a single
deterministic chaining function instead of scraping inline literals.

The four block modules keep emitting the same ``{verb, why, spec_hint}`` hint
(the human-facing rationale stays per-call); their ``_next_block`` helpers now
DELEGATE to :func:`next_block_hint`, which derives the verb from
:data:`SUCCESSORS`. So the block Result JSON is unchanged; only the SoT of the
successor verb moved here.

Terminology:

* **current_verb** — the block that just ran (e.g. ``"submit-s2"``).
* **stage_reached** — the terminator it stopped at (the ``stage_reached`` field
  on its Result; the union per family lives in ``_wire/workflows/*_blocks.py``).
* **successor** — the deterministic next block verb, or ``None`` at a genuine
  human branch / terminal (recovery has no single deterministic successor; a
  harvest terminator is the end of the chain).
