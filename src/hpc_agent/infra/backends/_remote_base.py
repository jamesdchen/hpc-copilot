"""Shared SSH-shim mixin for remote scheduler backends.

Both :class:`hpc_agent.infra.backends.sge_remote.RemoteSGEBackend`
and :class:`hpc_agent.infra.backends.slurm_remote.RemoteSlurmBackend`
need the exact same two overrides on top of their local cousin:

- ``_execute_command`` — wrap the scheduler invocation in
  ``cd <remote_repo> && <cmd>`` and run it via the injected ``ssh_run``
  callable.
- ``_setup_log_dir`` — ``mkdir -p`` the remote log dir over SSH.

This module exposes :class:`RemoteHPCBackend` as a mixin (placed FIRST
in the MRO) so each Remote backend simply does::

    class RemoteSGEBackend(RemoteHPCBackend, SGEBackend): ...

and inherits ``_build_command`` / ``_build_dependency_flag`` /
``JOB_ID_REGEX`` from the local class while overriding the two SSH
hooks here.

# --- S5: single-source REPO_DIR ↔ deploy target ----------------------------
#
# Every remote operation in the submit pipeline anchors on ONE string,
# ``remote_path``:
#
#   * ``rsync_push(remote_path=...)`` ships the experiment tree to
#     ``{ssh_target}:{remote_path}/`` (transport.rsync_push).
#   * ``deploy_runtime(remote_path=...)`` ships the framework files to the
#     SAME ``{remote_path}/`` (transport.deploy_runtime).
#   * the backend's ``remote_repo`` (where every ``cd "$REPO_DIR" && <cmd>``
#     lands, _execute_command below) is ``remote_path`` verbatim
#     (remote_factory.build_remote_backend).
#   * ``job_env["REPO_DIR"]`` is set to ``remote_path`` (build_submit_spec).
#
# So the rsync DESTINATION and the cluster-side ``REPO_DIR`` are, by
# construction, the same value — UNLESS a caller threads a divergent
# ``REPO_DIR`` (a stale/hand-rolled ``extra_env`` override, or a cached spec
# field) that overrides the one derived from ``remote_path``. That is exactly
# the drift the 2026-06 live canary hit: ``REPO_DIR=…/hpc-demo`` while rsync
# had deployed to ``…/demo-hpc``, so the per-task ``cd "$REPO_DIR" &&
# <executor>`` ran in a directory the executor was never deployed to and the
# dispatch failed.
#
# :func:`deploy_target_for` is the single derivation; build_submit_spec sets
# REPO_DIR from it AND asserts no override diverged. Keeping the derivation
# here (next to ``remote_repo`` / ``_execute_command``, which consume the same
# value) means the REPO_DIR ↔ deploy-target identity has one owner, not two
# independently-maintained call sites that can drift.

    normalisation here so an equality check against either is exact.

    The function is intentionally the (normalising) identity on *remote_path*:
    the framework has no separate deploy-destination computation that could
    legitimately diverge from ``REPO_DIR``. The point of routing both through
    one helper is that ``build_submit_spec`` can derive ``REPO_DIR`` from it and
    assert nothing overrode the result — so a stale/hand-rolled divergent

        ``cd <remote_repo> && <quoted-cmd>`` is the canonical pattern —
        the job script is referenced by relative path in the local
        backend's ``_build_command``, so we need to land in the right
        directory before invoking qsub/sbatch.

        The cd+submit is wrapped in ``bash -lc`` (LOGIN, non-interactive) so
        the remote shell sources the cluster's login profile sequence
        (``/etc/profile`` → ``/etc/profile.d/*.sh`` → ``~/.bash_profile``).
        Many clusters (Hoffman2/UGE, CARC, etc.) install ``qsub`` / ``sbatch``
        onto ``PATH`` only via that init — the bare ssh command channel is
        non-login and would fail ``bash: qsub: command not found``.

        Do NOT add ``-i`` here. An interactive bash on an ssh *exec* channel
        (no PTY — ``ssh_run`` allocates none) blocks: interactive init expects
        a terminal / job control and hangs until the ``_execute_command``
        120 s timeout fires, which the flow then misreports as
        ``dispatcher_failed`` (proving-run #2, 2026-07: ``bash -lic`` hung the
        Hoffman2 canary submit before qsub was ever reached, so nothing hit
        the scheduler; ``bash -lc`` resolves ``qsub`` at
        ``/u/systems/UGE8.6.4/bin/lx-amd64/qsub`` and returns cleanly). The
        earlier ``-i`` (commit cafb160b) rested on the assumption that some
        clusters expose the scheduler PATH only via an interactivity-guarded
        ``~/.bashrc``; that is empirically false on Hoffman2, and a cluster
        that genuinely needed it must express it through the preamble
        (``conda_source`` / ``modules``), never a globally-hanging ``-i``.

        Login-shell amortisation (proving-run-2 Phase-0 measurement,
        2026-07-04): sourcing that profile chain costs ~1.2 s *server-side*
        per call on Hoffman2 — twice the SSH handshake — with wild variance
        under login-node load (a 22.8 s outlier was observed). So the login
        shell is paid ONCE per (backend instance, binary): the first submit
        piggybacks ``command -v <bin>`` onto its own ``bash -lc`` round-trip
        (a ``__HPC_SUBMIT_BIN__=<path>`` marker on stderr — stderr, never
        stdout, which the job-id regex parses), and every later submit runs
        the cached absolute path with NO login shell. A cached path that
        stops resolving (exit 127 / stale after a cluster upgrade) is
        dropped and that call falls back to the login-shell form — the
