"""Factory for SSH-backed scheduler clients (``RemoteSGEBackend`` /
``RemoteSlurmBackend``).

The submit and recover subjects both need to build the same remote
backend object: same SSH transport, same scheduler dispatch, same
env-key forwarding. Living here means neither subject reaches into
the other's source tree.

The function raises :class:`~hpc_agent.errors.SpecInvalid` on an
unknown scheduler name — the same typed envelope error the callers
surface to the agent. Callers MUST validate ``ssh_target`` before
calling (see :func:`hpc_agent.infra.remote.validate_ssh_target`); the
factory does not double-validate.

    Both SGE and SLURM go through the cluster's login node via SSH —
    the local backends (which assume a local ``qsub``/``sbatch``
    binary) are never used here. ``submit-flow`` and ``resubmit-flow``
    are both laptop-driven.

    When *scheduler_profile* is given (a pinned / resolved
    :class:`~hpc_agent.infra.backends.profile.SchedulerProfile` dict from
    a cluster's ``clusters.yaml`` entry), the backend is built *bound to
    that profile* — the family it declares (``slurm`` / ``sge``) selects
    the command grammar and its data (regex, scripts, error vocabulary)
    overrides the golden default. This is how a non-default cluster's
    customised scheduler reaches the engine. Without it, the golden
    ``slurm`` / ``sge`` backends are used exactly as before.

    A *backend_name* outside the built-in families resolves through the
    backend registry: a plugin-registered backend constructs itself via
    :meth:`HPCBackend.from_build_context` (the SSH-on-a-login-node
    assumption above applies only to the built-in ladder; a plugin
    backend owns its own transport decisions).
