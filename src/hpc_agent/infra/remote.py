"""SSH and rsync utilities for remote HPC operations.

Provides thin wrappers around ssh/rsync so cluster commands can be
executed from a local machine without paramiko or other dependencies.

All functions take a single opaque ``ssh_target`` plus ``remote_path``.
``ssh_target`` is whatever ``ssh``/``scp``/``rsync`` accept as a
destination — either an explicit ``user@host`` (e.g.
``user@discovery2.usc.edu``) **or** an OpenSSH ``Host`` alias from
``~/.ssh/config`` (e.g. ``usc-discovery``). The alias form is preferred
because it lets ``IdentityFile`` / ``User`` / ``Hostname`` settings in
the user's ssh config flow through without us having to model them.

Every subprocess invocation in this module enforces a timeout so a flaky
cluster connection or paused rsync cannot block ``/submit``, ``/status``,
or ``/aggregate`` indefinitely.  The defaults are :data:`SSH_TIMEOUT_SEC`
for SSH/scp commands and :data:`RSYNC_TIMEOUT_SEC` for rsync transfers.
Callers may override per-call by passing ``timeout=`` (in seconds), or
disable enforcement entirely by passing ``timeout=None``.  When the
underlying child exceeds the timeout, the wrapper raises
:class:`TimeoutError` with a message that names the target and a snippet
of the command being run.

    On hosts where the ``rsync`` binary is not on PATH (typically
    Windows without WSL / MSYS rsync), automatically falls back to a
    ``tar c | ssh tar x`` pipeline. The fallback honors both *exclude*
    and *delete* — ``delete=True`` runs a remote pre-clean step before
    the tar extract so stale remote files do not survive a re-push.

    Parameters
    ----------
    ssh_target:
        ssh destination — either ``user@host`` or an OpenSSH alias.
    remote_path:
        Absolute path on the remote host (e.g. ``/u/home/user/project``).
    local_path:
        Local directory to push. Trailing slash is handled automatically.
    exclude:
        Rsync exclude patterns.  Defaults to :data:`DEFAULT_RSYNC_EXCLUDES`
        if *None*.
    delete:
        If True (default), pass ``--delete`` so removed local files are
        also removed on the remote. On the tar/ssh fallback this is
        emulated by a remote pre-clean step (see :func:`_tar_ssh_push`).
    timeout:
        Per-call subprocess timeout in seconds.  When omitted, the module
        default :data:`RSYNC_TIMEOUT_SEC` is applied.  Pass ``timeout=None``
        explicitly to disable timeout enforcement; the bare ``None`` is
        propagated through to ``subprocess.run``.

    Raises
    ------
    TimeoutError
