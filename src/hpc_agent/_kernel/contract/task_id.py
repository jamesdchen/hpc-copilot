"""Typed task-id coordinate spaces — make the 0-based/1-based boundary explicit.

A submitted array job carries a task identity in two coordinate spaces that
are trivially confusable because both are plain ``int``:

* :data:`HpcTaskId` — the **0-based** *domain* identity. This is what the
  framework and the user's ``tasks.resolve(task_id)`` reason about: the
  dispatcher's ``HPC_TASK_ID`` (``dispatch.py`` enforces ``0 <= id < n``),
  the per-task ``preempt`` marks + result-dir templating, the journal's
  ``retries`` keys, and ``resubmit_flow.failed_task_ids`` / the resubmit plan.
* :data:`ArrayIndex` — the **1-based** *scheduler-edge* coordinate:
  ``SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID`` / ``SGE_TASK_ID`` (jobs submit ``--array=1-N``) and
  the ``JobId_N`` task index ``sacct`` / ``qstat`` report back. The array
  templates recover the 0-based id with ``ARRAY_TASK_ID - 1``.

The conversion between the two is a single ``±1`` that is currently re-encoded
independently in several places — ``resubmit_plan`` adds 1 in Python, the
array templates subtract 1 in shell, and the status reporter just carries the
1-based index upward — so a space mix-up silently resubmits the *wrong* task
(it is invisible: both are ``int``). This module is the single home for that
conversion. Downstream work (#TBD: routing the conversion through the backend
query adapters so everything above the scheduler speaks ``HpcTaskId``) builds
on it; until then it is the canonical helper any boundary should call rather
than open-coding ``± 1``.

The ``NewType`` distinction is the load-bearing part: it lets a type checker
flag a function handed an ``ArrayIndex`` where an ``HpcTaskId`` is expected,
turning today's silent off-by-one into a static error. This mirrors the
codebase's existing "encode the invariant in the type system" pattern — c.f.
the :class:`~hpc_agent._kernel.contract.layout.RepoLayout` /
:class:`~hpc_agent._kernel.contract.layout.JournalLayout` split that turned the
``runs_*`` path collision into a type error, and the ``JournalStatus`` /
``FailureCategory`` StrEnums that single-source their vocabularies.

NOTE: ``NewType`` is a *static-only* distinction — at runtime both are ``int``,
so this catches mix-ups under ``mypy``, not at runtime. A frozen value object
would enforce it at runtime too, at the cost of friction at every call site;
the type-checker guarantee is the deliberate first rung (see the Phase-2 issue).
