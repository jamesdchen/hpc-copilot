"""Canonical CLI subprocess runner for tests.

Every test that shells out to ``python -m hpc_agent ...`` should funnel
through :func:`run_cli` rather than calling :func:`subprocess.run`
directly. The wrapper always passes ``timeout=`` (default 30s) so a
hanging production code path cannot pin CI indefinitely — a regression
that snuck in twice before this helper landed.

This module is the only file (besides the migration grandfathered set)
that may call :func:`subprocess.run` without a ``timeout=`` kwarg per
:mod:`tests.contracts.test_subprocess_timeout_discipline`.

Usage
-----

.. code-block:: python

    from tests._subprocess import run_cli

    proc = run_cli("capabilities", env={...}, timeout=10)
    assert proc.returncode == 0

The signature mirrors :func:`subprocess.run`'s keyword arguments so a
caller can pass ``cwd``, ``input``, ``env``, etc. without surprises.
