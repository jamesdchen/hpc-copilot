# Changelog

## Unreleased

### Added

- **MARs integration proposal package.**
  - `docs/mars-integration.md` — Bun.spawn env block, `error_code` →
    retry-policy mapping, troubleshooting flow for the silent-hang
    failure mode, journal-coexistence rules.
  - `docs/mars/experiment-runner.snippet.md` — paste-ready section for
    MARs's `agents/experiment-runner.md` covering preflight → submit →
    status → aggregate, decision rule for delegating to claude-hpc, and
    the full retry table.
  - `tests/test_docs_links.py` — drift guard ensuring every `error_code`
    and required env var mentioned in the proposal docs matches the
    code (`slash_commands/errors.py` and `capabilities.required_env`).
- **`capabilities` envelope additions** (additive, schema-compatible):
  - `mars_skill_paths` — absolute paths to bundled `skills/hpc-*/SKILL.md`
    so consumers can discover them without hardcoding the package layout.
  - `required_env` — env vars consumers must forward
    (`SSH_AUTH_SOCK`, `HPC_JOURNAL_DIR`, `HPC_CLUSTERS_CONFIG`).
- **README**: collapsed the "Using with MARs" section to a link to
  `docs/mars-integration.md`; kept the SSH-passthrough warning visible.

### Changed

- **`status`, `aggregate`, `reconcile` fail fast when `SSH_AUTH_SOCK` is
  unset.** Previously these subcommands hung indefinitely on auth — the
  most common Bun.spawn failure mode for orchestrators. They now emit
  `error_code: "ssh_unreachable"` (category `network`, `retry_safe: True`,
  exit 2) immediately. `submit` (journal-only) and `resubmit`
  (journal-only) are not gated.
- **`aggregate` gains framework-agnostic plumbing guarantees.** Three
  optional, additive checks help both human `/aggregate` users and
  agent CLI callers catch silent partial-data combines:
  - `--require-outputs <template>` — pre-combiner SSH check that every
    per-task output named by the template (with `{task_id}` placeholder)
    exists. Refuses to combine on partial data; surfaces a new
    `error_code: "outputs_missing"` (category `cluster`, `retry_safe: True`)
    listing the absent paths.
  - `--expect-output <path>` — post-combiner check that the declared
    artifact exists and (for `.json` paths) is parseable. A combiner
    that exits 0 but writes nothing now surfaces as `combiner_failed`
    immediately instead of producing a silent "successful" aggregate.
  - **Provenance** — the success envelope's `data` block always carries
    a `provenance` object: `{run_id, manifest, wave, profile, cluster,
    combined_at}`. When `--expect-output` is set, claude-hpc also
    writes a `_provenance.json` sidecar next to the output on the
    cluster (best-effort; envelope is the source of truth).
- **`hpc.yaml` defaults for the new aggregate flags.** Set
  `results.require_outputs` and `results.expect_output` once per profile
  to enforce the precondition/postcondition automatically on every
  aggregate. Explicit CLI flags override hpc.yaml. The
  `slash_commands/commands/aggregate.md` prompt now points users at
  this.

## 0.2.0 — 2026-04

Major refactor adding agent-facing CLI alongside the existing Claude Code slash
commands. Both surfaces share the same atomic-ops layer at
`slash_commands/runner.py` so cross-surface state stays consistent.

### Added

- **`hpc-mapreduce` CLI** (the agent surface). Subcommands: `submit`, `status`,
  `aggregate`, `reconcile`, `resubmit`, `preflight`, `discover`, `expand-grid`,
  `list-in-flight`, `clusters list|describe`, `capabilities`, `build-executor`.
  Stdout is a single-line JSON envelope; stderr is JSON-per-line log records.
  Exit codes: 0 ok, 1 user error, 2 cluster/network, 3 internal. Full schema
  in `docs/cli-spec.md`; runtime-validatable JSON Schemas under
  `hpc_mapreduce/schemas/`. Both `python -m hpc_mapreduce <cmd>` and
  `hpc-mapreduce <cmd>` work.
- **`/preflight` slash command** — health check matching the CLI subcommand,
  for Claude Code parity.
- **MARs SKILL.md files** under `skills/hpc-*/SKILL.md`. Drop-in workflow
  guidance for MARs orchestrator agents that invoke the CLI via the Bash tool.
- **Typed exception hierarchy** at `slash_commands/errors.py` (`HpcError` base
  with `error_code`, `retry_safe`, `category`, `remediation`). One source of
  classification, two presentations: CLI maps to envelope; slash commands let
  Claude format for the human.
- **SSH connection multiplexing** in `hpc_mapreduce/infra/remote.py`
  (`ControlMaster auto`, `ControlPersist 10m`). First call to a cluster opens
  the master socket; subsequent calls reuse it (~50ms vs ~500ms+). Opt-out
  via `HPC_NO_SSH_MULTIPLEX=1`.
- **Idempotent `submit`**. `submit_and_record` now returns
  `tuple[RunRecord, bool]`; the bool is `deduped`. Replaying a submit with the
  same spec returns the existing record and the cluster does not see duplicate
  qsub/sbatch calls. Removes a real correctness footgun for any caller that
  retries on transient network errors.
- **Last-status cache file** `<run_id>.last_status.json` written next to the
  journal record by `record_status`. Any consumer can read it for cheap
  cached state without re-issuing an SSH call.
- **Env-configurable state directories**:
  - `HPC_JOURNAL_DIR` overrides the journal location (default: `~/.claude/hpc/`).
  - `HPC_CLUSTERS_CONFIG` overrides the clusters.yaml path (default: shipped
    in the package).
- **`__version__`** on the `hpc_mapreduce` package, `--version` flag on the CLI.
- **`py.typed`** marker — `hpc_mapreduce` ships type hints to mypy/pyright.
- **New docs**: `docs/cli-spec.md`, `docs/config-precedence.md`,
  `docs/sync-checklist.md`.

### Changed

- **Renamed `agent/` → `slash_commands/`.** Disambiguates from MARs' own
  `agents/` concept. The directory is Claude Code slash-command glue, not an
  LLM agent. All Python imports `from agent import ...` → `from slash_commands
  import ...`. Plugin manifest at `.claude/commands/setup_hpc.md` updated.
  In-flight runs and on-cluster jobs are unaffected by the rename.
- **Renamed `/monitor` slash command → `/status`.** Verb collision with the
  built-in Claude Code `Monitor` tool that MARs orchestrators have available;
  the new name is also more accurate (one-shot snapshot, not a streaming
  watcher). CLI matches: `hpc-mapreduce status`. Existing in-flight runs and
  journal records pick up the rename without migration. Existing standalone
  Claude Code users will need to retrain on `/status`.
- **Relocated `config/clusters.yaml` → `hpc_mapreduce/config/clusters.yaml`**
  and `templates/{executor_template,chunking_shim,date_window_shim,shim_template}.py`
  → `hpc_mapreduce/templates/starters/`. Required for `pip install` from a
  wheel to ship with config and starter templates. **File contents are
  byte-identical** — only paths changed. Anyone who forked and customized
  these files will need to re-apply their edits at the new paths.
- **`_PACKAGE_ROOT` repurposed.** Previously the repo root; now points at the
  `hpc_mapreduce/` package directory itself. Affects path resolutions like
  `_PACKAGE_ROOT / "config" / "clusters.yaml"` (still works because the file
  moved into the package). External users importing `_PACKAGE_ROOT` to
  resolve paths in their own forks: audit your usages.
- **`submit_and_record` return type** changed from `RunRecord` to
  `tuple[RunRecord, bool]`. Callers must unpack: `record, deduped = ...`.
- **`pyproject.toml` packages discovery** changed from `["hpc_mapreduce*",
  "agent*"]` to `["hpc_mapreduce*", "slash_commands*"]`. Added
  `[project.scripts]` for the `hpc-mapreduce` console entry, and
  `[tool.setuptools.package-data]` so wheels bundle config + templates +
  schemas.

### Not changed (deliberately)

- **No MCP server.** MARs agents invoke external code through the Bash tool;
  a CLI is the right shape for that pattern. MCP would require adding a
  wrapper tool inside MARs. Revisit only if MARs itself shifts to
  surfacing MCP servers as first-class agent tools.
- **No cancel/abort subcommand.** `settings.json` denies `scancel`/`qdel`.
  If you decide an experiment is bad, stop waiting on it; cluster jobs run
  to walltime.
- **No local-execution backend.** claude-hpc is the HPC-on-cluster path;
  MARs already iterates locally via uv/Docker.
- **No deprecation shim for old `agent.*` imports.** Standalone users invoke
  the package via slash commands (which we update atomically) or the new CLI;
  external scripts importing `agent.*` directly do a one-time migration to
  `slash_commands.*`. The version bump signals the break.

### Migration notes for current standalone users

A user who pulls 0.2.0 and continues using claude-hpc as a Claude Code plugin
will see:

- **All four legacy slash commands work identically** modulo the verb rename:
  `/submit`, `/status` (was `/monitor`), `/aggregate`, `/build-executor`. New
  `/preflight` is added.
- **In-flight runs** at `~/.claude/hpc/<hash>/runs/*.json` continue to load
  unchanged — `schema_version` stays at 1.
- **Cluster-side jobs** already submitted run to completion as before;
  `dispatch.py` and `combiner.py` are untouched.
- **Customized `config/clusters.yaml`** at the old location: re-apply at
  `hpc_mapreduce/config/clusters.yaml`, OR set `HPC_CLUSTERS_CONFIG=/path/to/yours`.
- **Customized templates** at `templates/*.py`: re-apply at
  `hpc_mapreduce/templates/starters/*.py`.
- A user mid-conversation in Claude Code during the upgrade may hit one
  transient error as the model attempts to call the old `agent.*` path.
  Restarting the session fixes it.
