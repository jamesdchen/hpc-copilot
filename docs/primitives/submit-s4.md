## Purpose

Submit block **S4 — harvest** (docs/design/human-amplification-blocks.md §3).
Runs `aggregate-flow` (ensure every wave combined → pull partials → reduce) and
digests the reduced metrics into a code-extracted **results table**, plus an
empty slot for the LLM's proposed interpretations. Ends at the results-table
brief for the `y`/nudge loop: code extracts the results; the human concludes from
them (§2 — the #355 doctrine extended from *computing* results to *concluding*
from them). Results are never interpreted raw by the LLM.

## Inputs

A `SubmitS4Spec` JSON spec with:

- `aggregate` — a nested [`AggregateFlowSpec`](aggregate-flow.md) (run_id,
  output_dir, combine/pull/reduce knobs).

## Outputs

A `SubmitBlockResult` (`block="s4"`, `needs_decision=true`) with a `brief`:

- `run_id`.
- `results_table` — a stable row-per-key projection of the reduced metrics
  (`[{key, metrics}, ...]`, sorted).
- `combined_waves`, `failed_waves`, `escalation_reason`,
  `nonempty_failing_task_ids`, `column_violations` — integrity signals from
  `aggregate-flow`.
- `proposed_interpretations` — handed over **empty**; the slot the LLM fills at
  the `y`/nudge boundary. Concluding is the human's decision.

`stage_reached` ∈ `harvested` (every wave combined cleanly) · `harvest_partial`
(some waves escalated — review the table before concluding).

## Errors

`spec_invalid`, `ssh_unreachable`, `remote_command_failed`.

## Idempotency

Idempotent on `aggregate.run_id` — `aggregate-flow` is safe to re-run (combine +
reduce are idempotent).

## Notes

Unit B is adding a `harvest_on_terminal` guarantee (§5, guaranteed harvest) in
parallel. S4 currently calls the EXISTING `aggregate-flow` entry; once the
guarantee lands, route S4 through the guaranteed-harvest path so every terminal
state — completion, anomaly, cap overrun, partial kill — ends in this table.

## Usage

```
hpc-agent submit-s4 --spec spec.json --experiment-dir <dir>
```

Present the `results_table`; the LLM drafts interpretation options into the empty
slot; the human answers `y` (accept an interpretation) or a nudge.
